# Hamoye-Stage-One-Assessment

### Context:
Electric Utilities report a huge amount of information to government and public agencies. They include very granular data on fuel burned, electricity generated, power plant usage patterns, plant capacity factors and emissions from greenhouse gases. However, this data is not well documented and sometimes they are provided in a format that makes it difficult to understand.

At the end of this module (Introduction to Python for Machine Learning), a graded quiz had to be taken, whose questions are provided in the Jupyter notebook as well as my working and answers.
